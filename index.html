            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support
                life. 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is
                covered with water, mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes,
                rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions
                is covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate
                across the surface over many millions of years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron
                inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convective mantle that
                drives plate tectonics.</p><br>

            <p id="second-para">Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received
                by tropical
                regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases
                also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only
                determined by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans, among other factors.
                Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and
                greatly impacts life.</p>

            <h2>MOON</h2>
            <div class="img-div">

            </div>
            <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the
                width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of
                its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known
                dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a
                satellite planet under geophysical definitions of the term. It lacks any significant atmosphere,
                hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's
                moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.
            </p><br>

            <p id="second-para">Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times
                Earth's diameter,
                its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The
                Moon's orbit around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days. During each synodic period of 29.5 days,
                the amount of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar
                phases that form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth,
                which means that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on its own axis causes its same side (the
                near side) to always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day is the same as the synodic period.
                That said, 59% of the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth through shifts in perspective due to
                libration.</p>

            <h2>SUN</h2>
            <div class="img-div">

            </div>
            <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,
                heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible
                light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for
                life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of
                Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass
                of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest
                is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon,
                neon and iron.</p><br>

            <p id="second-para">According to its spectral class, the Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V). As such,
                it is informally,
                and not completely accurately, referred to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow).
                It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter
                within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas the rest
                flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot and dense
                that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by
                this process.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's
                appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be
                individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via
                lactea, from the Greek γαλακτικός κύκλος (galaktikos kýklos), meaning "milky circle." From
                Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo
                Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the
                early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.
                Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,
                observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</p><br>

            <p id="second-para">The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy with an estimated visible diameter of
                100,000–200,000
                light-years. Recent simulations suggest that a dark matter disk, also containing some visible stars, may
                extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years. The Milky Way has several satellite
                galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is
                itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.</p>
